  # Note: LocalStack init scripts have been replaced with Go-based seeding.
  # Test data is now seeded programmatically using the seed package.
  # See test/e2e/localstack/seed/ for implementation details.

  # The seeding is triggered by the E2E test suite after LocalStack is ready,
  # ensuring type-safe, maintainable test data creation.

  # Placeholder to keep ConfigMap valid (LocalStack doesn't require scripts anymore)
